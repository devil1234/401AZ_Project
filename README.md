## **Project Scenario:**

Harris & Sons Education Consulting LTD have encountered an emerging need to have all their content and timetables hosted on a Cloud hosted relational database; This should allow all teaching staff to access and manage teaching material, assigned students and classes. This will be accessed via a desktop application. They require that the solution be built and documented, including the applications architectural design. You are also required to create the teaching material on the electro-mechanical and mathematical principles underpinning logic and memory. This will be based on the following criteria:

 - Use a cloud managed database service to store information including
	 - Teaching materials (Logic Gates, Boolean Algebra and Memory Addressing) 
	 - Staff details  
	 - Studentsâ€™ details 
	 - Classes Enrolment
	 - Provide a database normalised to 3NF, at minimum.    
	 - Create a Windows(desktop) application to enable database management.

**Project Approach**
You will develop and present your relational database connected application using a Cloud-Based DB platform and Object-Oriented Desktop Application (10 min +/- 10% presentation).

You will also submit a reflective report (1,500 words), discussing and reflecting on the developed application and appropriate usage of SQL and compiled language used in real-life industry to complete the given scenario. During your report you are to reflect on the technologies used, development & testing of the application and how the architectural design of the application has evolved.

**Deliverables:**

**Live**  **Presentation (10 Minutes)**
 - [x] > **Final Annotated ER Database Designs.**
 - [ ] > **UML diagrams (Use Case, Class, Sequence).**
 - [ ] > **Demonstration of the application.**

**Reflective Report (1500 Words) (You should include the following at minimum)**

> **A reflection on SQL Usage.**

> **A reflection on OOP Language Usage.**

> **A reflection on the industry-standard technologies used during development.**

> **A reflection on testing (Unit, Integration).**

> **A reflection on changes in the design of the application during development.**

**Teaching Material uploaded to submission point**

**Code in Zip Archive uploaded to submission point.**

**Resit Task**

Rework of the original attempt, together with a reflective piece detailing the changes made and your understanding of how the work now meets the learning outcomes.
